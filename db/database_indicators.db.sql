Through dialogue between public and private actors, we develop comparative advantages and initiate multisectoral economic flows.

Promotion of good governance goes beyond the government sector and includes all relevant actors from the private sector and society.

We advise our partners on agricultural and rural development policy. Farmers and associations are involved in decisions and organisational deficits are addressed. This is the only way to give poor people in rural areas access to land, water, loans and training. In cooperation with academic institutions and the private sector, we develop strategies for increasing production and income under changing conditions in agriculture and fishing, in ways which do not burden the environment or reduce biodiversity. At the same time, it is important to develop rural infrastructure and create access to markets.

In this way, we aim to stabilise fragile contexts in order to make development a reality for all sections of society.

Our strength lies in linking short-term aid with long-term prospects. In the security sector, we support the demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants and provide advice on the build up and reform of capable, democratically legitimate and monitored institutions.');
