## üöß Limitations of the Prototype

- **No Production Features**: This version does not include critical production-ready features, such as user authentication or advanced security measures.
- **Demonstration Focus**: The architecture and codebase were designed for rapid prototyping and proof-of-concept purposes rather than for scalability or long-term use.
- **Recommendation**: If you intend to use an indicator catalog in a real-world context, we strongly recommend developing a new version from scratch, following best practices in archit
